  Furhter coverage on the Flu vaccination mega study in Forbes. Here's a quote
  from the article - The researchers are optimistic that that what they've
  learned about the flu will help with COVID. "Our results suggest a promising
  way to encourage COVID-19 vaccinations at scale—we can potentially help save
  lives for less than 10¢ per person,” said Katy Milkman, Wharton professor,
  BCFG Co-Director, and lead author on the study. In the end, said Mitesh Patel,
  Penn Medicine Professor and PMNU Director, such seemingly small tweaks could
  "nudge vaccination rates higher and help us end this pandemic faster.”
