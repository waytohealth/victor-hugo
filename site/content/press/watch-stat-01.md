  A write-up on the efficacy of COVID Watch based on [this](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M21-2019) recently published analysis on the effectiveness of the program. The program was designed and continues to run on Way to Health and has managed over 20,000 patients thus far. In summary, it reduces the odds of mortality by 68% by connecting with patients sooner and getting them into the hospital asap when appropriate. At the height of the pandemic, the data indicates that the program was saving at least one life every other day.
