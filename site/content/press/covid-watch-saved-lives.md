title: COVID Watch Saved Lives
date: 2021-12-08
summary: The Watch program was built to monitor patients exhibiting COVID or
  COVID like symptoms and were not deemed to be serious enough to be admitted to
  the hospital. The program regularly checked in with the patient and if
  necessary, was escalated to receive care immediately. The results continue to
  seen and as the article mentions, "We found that overall mortality was less
  than 1% in both groups at 60 days. However, five of 3,448 (0.14%) COVID Watch
  patients died compared to 16 of 4,377 (0.37%) patients who received usual
  care. After risk adjustment, this is 2.5 fewer deaths per 1,000 patients
  enrolled and a 66% lower odds of death."
