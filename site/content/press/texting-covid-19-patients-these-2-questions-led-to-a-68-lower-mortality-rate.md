title: Texting Covid-19 patients these 2 questions led to a 68% lower mortality rate
date: 2021-11-17
summary: "Another write-up on the effectiveness of COVID Watch. The simplicity
  of the program combined with a backend of on-demand 24x7 nursing staff and
  clinicians (up to a amximum of 7 during the height of the pandemic) led to
  significant mortality reduction as detailed
  [here](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M21-2019). The program was
  designed and continues to run on Way to Health and has managed over 20,000
  patients thus far. In summary, it reduces the odds of mortality by 68% by
  connecting with patients sooner and getting them into the hospital asap when
  appropriate.  "
