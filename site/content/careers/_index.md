          description: Every day, month, and year we're addressing bigger and more interesting challenges. We learn, we get better, we do more. If you're looking for something boring and comfortable, we might not be a good fit. But c'mon...

        - subtitle: Driven but balanced
          description: We believe in the mission of what we're doing, and are enthusiastic about and dedicated to our work. We're also dedicated to our outside lives, children, pets, and hobbies - we leave work on time, and work-life balance is important to us.

        - subtitle: Collaborative
          description: We operate collaboratively across functions. We value and respect each other's skills, backgrounds, personal quirks, contributions, and limitations. We have implementation specialists writing regexes, developers writing product requirements - whatever makes sense for the product and the team. We all have input on the product and on how we work.
          id: remote
        - subtitle: Flexible
          description: We tend to work pretty standard business hours, but are flexible because life is more than work. Work your schedule, get things done, and show up on time to meetings. Definitely no timesheets or billable hours, or needing to request PTO to leave early for your kid's little league game. (We might ask you to livestream that game just so some of us can reminisce and offer some backseat coaching.)
        - subtitle: Remote / On-site
          description: Since March 2020 we've been working entirely remotely. We've become very comfortable on Teams / Zoom - that's where we do most of our meetings, pairing sessions, 1-on-1s, and so on. Before the pandemic we worked from home one day a week, and once the office reopens we predict we'll be in our office on the Penn campus 1-3 days a week.
