  Effect of Behaviorally Designed Gamification With Social Incentives on Lifestyle Modification Among Adults With Uncontrolled Diabetes
date: '2021-05-24'
summary: >-
  In this randomized clinical trial of 361 adults with overweight or obesity and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, gamification interventions designed to enhance support or competition each significantly increased physical activity relative to controls during the 1-year intervention, but gamification with collaboration did not significantly change physical activity relative to controls. All study arms had significant reductions in weight and hemoglobin A1c levels from baseline, but none of the gamification interventions resulted in significant differences in these outcomes relative to controls.
