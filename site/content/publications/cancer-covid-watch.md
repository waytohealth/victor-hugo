  Cancer COVID Watch: A feasibility study of intensive remote symptom monitoring via automated text messages with integrated nurse practitioner triage for patients with cancer and suspected or confirmed COVID-19
date: '2021-05-28'
summary: >-
  Patients with cancer are at greater risk of developing severe symptoms and dying from COVID-19 than the general population. Early detection of worsening symptoms and rapid nurse practitioner assessment may identify patients with cancer and suspected COVID-19 who require escalation of care while limiting strain on healthcare resources. Patients with concerning symptoms were adherent with Cancer COVID Watch and mostly managed in the outpatient setting. Efforts to manage symptomatic patients with cancer during future pandemics could use a similar approach. This was a modification of the COVID Watch program applied specifically to cancer patients and monitored by oncologists.
