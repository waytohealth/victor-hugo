  Testing Program with Automated Scheduling and Reporting

summary: >-
  To safely reopen schools and businesses, widespread surveillance testing for
  Covid-19 will be necessary. We quickly designed and implemented a surveillance
  testing program that remotely enrolls participants, uses automated
  bidirectional text message communications, incorporates symptom monitoring,
  and automatically reports test results.
