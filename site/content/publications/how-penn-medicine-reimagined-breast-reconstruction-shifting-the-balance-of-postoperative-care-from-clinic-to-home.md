articlename2: CARe - Connected Approach to Recovery
title: >-
  How Penn Medicine Reimagined Breast Reconstruction, Shifting the Balance of
  Postoperative Care from Clinic to Home
date: '2021-03-10'
summary: >-
  This program challenged a long-standing status quo that required patients to
  commute to and from the clinic for drain management and removal. High patient
  satisfaction scores reflected not only this convenience, but also a design
  that reimagined the delivery of education and clinical services while ensuring
  a more patient-centric return to independence. CARe, which, in a Covid-19
  environment allowed patients to reliably receive uninterrupted postoperative
  care safely in their homes, has been expanded to additional surgical patient
  populations across multiple hospitals and home health agencies.
