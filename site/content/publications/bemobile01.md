  Participants in the gamification arm also select a support partner who receives weekly updates on their progress in the game. The primary outcome is change in daily steps from baseline during the intervention period. The secondary outcome is difference in the proportion of days participants achieved their daily step goal. Results from this trial will inform future, larger studies that leverage insights from behavioral economics to help improve daily physical activity post-stroke.
