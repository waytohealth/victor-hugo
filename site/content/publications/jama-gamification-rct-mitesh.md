  Effect of Goal-Setting Approaches Within a Gamification Intervention to Increase Physical Activity Among Economically Disadvantaged Adults at Elevated Risk for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events - the ENGAGE RCT

summary: >-
  Whatâ€™s the best way to set goals to help economically disadvantaged patients at elevated risk for heart attacks improve healthy behaviors? In a new clinical trial out today in JAMA Cardiology, we found significant improvements in physical activity during a gamification intervention when a patient chose their step goal (rather than being assigned) and when targets were implemented immediately (rather than gradually). This led to a 1400 step per day increase compared to control for 16 weeks and then this level was sustained during an additional 8 weeks of follow-up. With just one text message per day, the average patient in the intervention walked about 120 miles more than the average patient in control! The study was powered by Way to Health.
