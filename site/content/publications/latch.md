  Text Message–Based Breastfeeding Support Compared With Usual Care
date: '2022-11-01'
summary: >-
  The program planned to evaluate whether a postpartum text message–based communication platform improves breastfeeding rates. When stratified by race, Black patients in the intervention arm had 2.6 times higher odds of exclusively breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum compared with Black patients in the control arm. Enrollment in the intervention arm decreased the Black–non-Black disparity in the primary outcome. There were no differences in other secondary outcomes.
