title: Developing a Chatbotâ€“Clinician Model for Hypertension Management
date: 2022-10-19
summary: The University of Pennsylvania Health System implemented a prototype
  chatbot to reduce message burden on clinicians in a text-based remote
  hypertension management program. The chatbot accurately triaged 99% of patient
  messages (1,379 of 1,393), with most messages, nearly 75% (1,073), not
  requiring escalation to the clinician. The authors share both their approach
  for building while doing using innovation methodology and the lessons learned
  in developing a chatbot for clinical care.
