  Remote patient-reported symptoms and passive activity monitoring to improve patient-clinician communication regarding symptoms and functional status: A randomized controlled trial (PROStep).
date: '2022-06-01'
summary: >-
  Clinician and patient-directed dashboards based on patient-generated health data did not lead to higher patient-perceived clinician understanding of symptoms and functional status, although this was limited by moderate adherence to remote symptom and step count collection and low frequency of clinician discussion of PROStep data with patients, highlighting challenges to clinical application of these data sources. Further efforts are needed to improve patient-clinician communication about symptoms and functional status.
