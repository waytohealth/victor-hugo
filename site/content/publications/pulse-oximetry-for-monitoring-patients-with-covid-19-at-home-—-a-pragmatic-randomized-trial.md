title: " Pulse Oximetry for Monitoring Patients with Covid-19 at Home â€” A
  Pragmatic, Randomized Trial"
date: 2022-04-06
summary: "This is a letter to NEJM that summarizes the results of a pragmatic
  randomized control trial to evaluate the difference in outcomes between
  patient subjective self-reported dyspnea and objective (pulse oximeter)
  dyspnea for remote monitoring of patients with COVID or exhibiting COVID-like
  symptoms. Summary: No difference. While this applies specifically in the
  context of this condition, it is something to consider and evaluate in the
  context of remote patient monitoring programs to see whether devices are
  indeed worth the investment and the challenges that go along with them."
