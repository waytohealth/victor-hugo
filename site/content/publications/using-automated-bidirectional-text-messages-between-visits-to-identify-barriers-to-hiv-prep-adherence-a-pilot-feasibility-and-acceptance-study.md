title: "Using automated bidirectional text messages between visits to identify
  barriers to HIV prep adherence: A pilot feasibility and acceptance study"
date: 2021-07-01
summary: This is a parternship between University of Pennsylvania and
  Philadel-phia FIGHT, a federally qualified health center. PrEP Retention
  Coordinators (PRCs) are non-clinician FIGHT staff who currently text patients
  on PrEP ad hoc to improve retention and adherence.The aim of this study is to
  co-design an automated texting intervention with PRCs and patients to
  systematically identify patients experiencing barriers to PrEP. With PRCs, we
  developed a series of automated text screening questionsto be administered
  over 3 months, the standard interval between PrEP follow-up appointments. We
  also co-designed the criteria and protocols for escalatingcases to PRCs for
  further intervention.
