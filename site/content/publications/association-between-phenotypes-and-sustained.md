  Association between behavioral phenotypes and sustained use of smartphones and wearable devices to remotely monitor physical activity
date: '2021-11-02'
summary: >-
  Smartphones and wearable devices can be used to remotely monitor health behaviors, but little is known about how individual characteristics influence sustained use of these devices. This leverages techniques such as latent class analysis (LCA) and uses a broad range of data to classify individuals into specific behavioral phenotypes. This in turn can be used to predict usage and adherence to physical activity regimes epecially following hospital discharges.
