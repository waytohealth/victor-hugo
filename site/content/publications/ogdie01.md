  Stepping up for inflammatory arthritis - a pilot trial to test behavioral economics strategy to increase physical activity in inflammatory arthritis
date: '2022-08-17'
summary: >-
  While financial incentives have worked well in patients without arthritis, the estimated effect of the financial incentive in this small study was more modest in patients with RA and PsA. Those that were able to increase their physical activity and meet their step goals had greater improvements in symptoms over the course of the study.
