  Comparative Effectiveness of an Automated Text Messaging Service for Monitoring COVID-19 at Home
date: '2021-11-16'
summary: >-
  A secondary analysis of data from Watch patients showed that enrollment in an automated text messaging service among community-dwelling adults newly diagnosed with COVID-19 in outpatient settings was associated with reduced mortality (up to 68%), potentially explained by increased and earlier presentation to the ED by those benefiting from early interventions. These results reveal a model for outpatient health system management of patients with COVID-19 and possibly other conditions where the early detection of clinical declines is critical.
