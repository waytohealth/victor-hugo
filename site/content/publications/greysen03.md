  Exploring Wearables to Focus on the “Sweet Spot” of Physical Activity and Sleep After Hospitalization: Secondary Analysis 
date: '2022-04-27'
summary: >-
  Participants within the “sweet spot” that balances recommended sleep (7-9 hours/night) and physical activity (>5000 steps/day) reported better functional outcomes after 13 weeks compared with participants outside the “sweet spot.” Wearable sleep and activity trackers may provide opportunities to hone postdischarge monitoring and target a “sweet spot” of recommended levels for both sleep and activity needed for optimal recovery.
