title: An Accelerated Hospital Observation Pathway to Reduce Length of Stay for
  Patients With COVID-19
date: 2021-11-17
summary: Strategies to maintain hospital capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic
  included reducing hospital length of stay (LOS) for infected patients. This
  program sought to evaluate the association between LOS and enrollment in the
  COVID Accelerated Care Pathway, which consisted of a hospital observation
  protocol and post-discharge automated text message–based monitoring. This
  program showed a reduction in hospital length of stay by more than 2 days.
