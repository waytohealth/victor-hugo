## Collection of Other Information
We and our third-party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:

### Through your browser or device:
Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device. We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.

### Through your use of the App

When you download and use the App, we and our third-party service providers may track and collect App usage data, which may include the following:

- **Driving data**. Includes information such as speed, acceleration, phone usage and location, using GPS, time information, and phone sensor data such as the magnetometer, gyroscope, and accelerometer. Because the App is not connected to your vehicle, it will collect the driving information of any vehicle you occupy, even as a passenger. The App will use phone sensor data to determine if you are the passenger during a driving trip.
- **Mobile phone information**. Includes Wi-Fi status, whether your screen is locked or you are using your phone, motion activity, whether the phone is connected to a Bluetooth® device, and date/time stamps. The App does not record the content of your communications, who you are communicating with, or the app(s) you are using.
- **App analytics information**. Includes how often you use the App, which mobile screens you have viewed in the App, aggregated App usage, App performance data and other App activity.
- The App is intended to collect your driving information, but may inadvertently collect the driving information of third parties with whom you are a passenger in their vehicle. Trip information may be collected on the app, such as length of trip, speed, and your phone usage (not the phone usage of third parties). No records will be created that identify any such third parties.

### How We Use Data Collected through our Services

- We use the data we receive to meet the aims and objectives of our research trials. Some examples of how we may use the data include:

  - Investigating the factors that impact safe driving 
  - Providing you with feedback about your driving during the study
  - Performing exploratory analyses

- Driving data and mobile phone information collected by the App will be retained on your mobile phone for several days and will then be deleted from the App, but an overview report of your driving trips will be available in the App for a limited time.
- We limit access to the data we receive and use physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to help protect it and your privacy. We will retain this data for as long as needed for research and operational purposes. 
- App analytics information is used to help us understand how you interact with the App, so that we can continue to improve the experience.

### Using technology to track use of services and improve the services

### IP Address

Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering the Services. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.

### Physical Location
We will collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals. We will record this information through the Way to Drive App and use your device’s physical location to collect relevant information for research and/or operational purposes. Your physical location data will only be recorded by the App when your device is moving more than five miles per hour (considered a driving trip event). We will be unable to enroll you in our research trials if you do not share your device’s physical location with us.
