This is intended to provide guidance on Penn Medicine's SMS based patient care programs. An examples of this service is [COVID Watch](https://covidwatch.waytohealth.org).

1. When you opt-in to the service, we will send you an SMS message to confirm your signup.

2. When you enroll into the program, participants will receive the following message (subject to minor modifications): "*Hello {{first name}}. Welcome to the Penn Medicine Home Symptom Tracker. This is for people with cold or flu like symptoms. During this COVID-19 outbreak, we understand you are concerned. In this program, we will text you twice a day to see how you are feeling and make sure you get the care you need. Please note that texting is not 100% secure so it is possible for someone else to read these messages. Finally,  Message & Data rates may apply. Reply OK if you agree. Reply END if you do not want to be supported by this Penn Medicine program*"

3. You can cancel the SMS service at any time. Just text "END" or "BYE" to the short code. After you send the SMS message "END" or "BYE" to us, you will be unsubscribed from the program. After this, you will no longer receive SMS messages from us. If you want to join again, a care provider will have to enroll you back into the program.
