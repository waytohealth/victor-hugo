title: Focus on scaling and performance
date: 2021-07-30
summary: >-
  From the very beginning of the COVID pandemic, Way to Health (W2H) has worked with Penn Medicine to implement numerous remote-monitoring programs across the health system. In implementing these programs, we scaled the number of people enrolled in a W2H program exponentially - going from ~70,000 to ~1,250,000 participant accounts in one year. This was a massive accomplishment for W2H, but it also meant that we needed to scale the platform to accommodate the change in user volume. Therefore, we focused our efforts in July 2021 on improving W2H performance at scale.

## Product updates from July 2021

The most impactful change we made was the incorporation of Scout APM to help us troubleshoot slow pages and backend operations. We were able to identify areas in W2H that needed improvements, and map out which issues to focus on for the month. Many of these performance improvements helped us speed up user access to data-heavy pages in W2H, as well as increase the speed at which data is processed in our queues. We plan to continue using Scout APM to monitor W2H’s performance, and to make further improvements as needed. 

Below is a summary of the enhancement work and bug fixes completed in July 2021.
