## Product updates from March 2022

Lens Analytics product offering consists of three main components:
1. Lens Analytics portal: Way to Health's business intelligence tool where users can ask questions of their data and have them visualized in meaningful ways. 
2. Data stores: Our custom analytics databases replicating production data.
3. ETLs: ('Extract, Transform, Load') These are standard and custom data sets which can be displayed and queried on via the Lens Analytics portal.

## What does this mean for our users?
You can now build custom reports and data visualizations in the Lens Analytics portal.
