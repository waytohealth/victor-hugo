title: Best pratices to increase patient engagement - Part 1
date: '2021-11-12'
summary: >-
  This is part one of a series focused on various evidence based techniques to increase patient engagement. The content in these posts are based on learnings from roughly 300 programs that have been managed by Way to Health across multiple clinical conditions and procedures. This series will provide examples and references whenever possible. This particular post will provide a high-level overview and framework for patient engagement projects and also provide some case study highlights.

## Introduction
The intent of this series is to provide a guide to health systems and health plans on what to try and more importantly, not try. The secondary intent is to perhaps just provide a perspective on how patient engagement has been and is increasingly viewed based on our experience with the numerous programs we operate. The term has been used very loosely over the past several years and currently seems to include everything from one-time text messages to ongoing diabetes management. These are obviously very different engagements and therefore need to be evaluated and measured differently. Finally, and this is a pet peeve of mine, lots of vendors out there seem to promise the world in terms of re-admission reductions and other numbers but provide *zero* context around the number of patients using the program, the number and type of facilities and so on. Evidence based practices are the answer to this problem, in my opinion, and I will endeavor to provide a framework for evaluation of programs either in this post or the next one.

## Press & Publications

More details of this project are now available. A recent publication in NEJM Catalyst titled "[Covid SAFE: Rapid Implementation of a Saliva-Based SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance Testing Program with Automated Scheduling and Reporting](https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.21.0014)" details out all the specifics and numbers described above.
