summary: SMART-HABITS is a crossover trial exploring the use of mHealth to
  improve self-management among pre-chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. All
  participants receive FitBit step count monitoring with reminders. Half of the
  participants start with blood pressure monitoring using an Omron blood
  pressure cuff and crossover to texting in their blood pressures, and half do
  the opposite. Additionally, all participants receive educational messaging and
  information about social support resources.
