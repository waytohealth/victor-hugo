summary: >
  The intent of this project is to create a texting algorithm that will support post-operative calls with gyn-oncology patients. Enabling texting communication that would filter the acuity, and would allow over-burdened nursing staff to triage the patients in a more timely way, while still connecting with all of the patients post-operatively.  If deployed, we see the scaling across the remainder of our surgical sub-specialties as a possibility.
