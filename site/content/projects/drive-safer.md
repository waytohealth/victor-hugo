summary: >-
  The intent of this study is to explore ways in which drivers could be incentivized to reduce mobile phone usage while driving. The goal being to reduce distracted driving related accidents. The study called for a partnership with Progressive Insurance and integration with its mobile application (managed by TrueMotion) to collect usage information. Multiple techniques such as possible insurance discounts, delivery of a phone mount, pre-commitment pledges, informational reminders, peer comparisons / leaderboards were used and are being evaluated. Initial results seem to indicate at least a couple of those techniques had success during the program and also during the follow-up period.
