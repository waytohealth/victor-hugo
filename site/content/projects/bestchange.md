summary: >-
  The estimated 84 million US adults with prediabetes can significantly reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by engaging in a Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) or using metformin. Although these evidence-based clinical preventive services are widely available, very few patients with prediabetes are currently using them. There is thus a critical need to identify ways to increase engagement of patients with prediabetes in strategies to prevent or delay their progression to T2DM. The intent is to try various techniques such as financial incentives (lotteries), self-determination theory (SDT) and tailored messaging to see what works best versus control.
