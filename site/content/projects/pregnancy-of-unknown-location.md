summary: Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) is an automated texting program to
  manage follow up care for pregnancies not seen by ultrasound. Participants are
  reminded to return for blood draws every 2 days to measure their beta HCG
  levels and are also asked whether they have any worsening symptoms through
  text conversation. Abnormal HCG or symptoms result in patient follow up to
  determine whether the pregnancy is progressing as expected.
