summary: >
  The Symptom Assessment Management program captures patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to understand how IV or Oral chemotherpay treatments impact the patient's quality of life (QOL). The program's extensive PRO algorithm was developed based on PRO-CTCAE grading and severity. Patients receive the PRO survey over text after their first treatment appointment multiple times over a 2-6 months to guage the impact on their QOL. This in turn can drive clinical decisions.
