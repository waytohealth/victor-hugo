summary: >
  The intent of this project is to capture patient reported outcomes (PROs) using an abbreviated version of the PRO-CTCAE survey as a pre-cursor to patient clinic visits. Patients receive a brief version of the survey over text and if necessary, a fuller version is as a survey link. This helps provide additional context to clinicians pre-visit. This is primarily focused on GI patients.
