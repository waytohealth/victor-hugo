summary: >
  Patients have delayed a number of wellness and care visits due to COVID. The intent of this program is to outreach to a broader population of Primary Care service line patients. This is in partnership with PCSL and Radiology. This is planned as a 2x2 factorial design RCT, as half the patients (about 17,000) will receive follow-up text messaging navigation. The goal is to show the health system that this might increase uptake so there can be sustainable resources to support bulk ordering, navigation, and text messaging.
