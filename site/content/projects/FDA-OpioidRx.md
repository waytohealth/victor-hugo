summary: >-
  This program monitors pain management and opioid prescriptions for patients after surgery at Penn Medicine. This is a replacement for an existing program with an external vendor. The program implemented on Way to Health eliminates almost all of the manual work requires to run the program. It also adds bi-directional texting conversations with patients post-discharge to gather additional data from patients.
