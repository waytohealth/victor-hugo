summary: >-
  Vaccinations are critical to getting the country back on track. This program was designed to reach out to patients who either did not have a patient portal account or have a valid email address on file. The intent here was to try and reach out to patients that Penn Medicine interacted with sometime during the last three years and offer the vaccine based on their availability. The program also asked if they already had received the vaccine or were hesitant. The program reached over 300,000 patients and for the people for whom we had accurate information and indicated interest, the conversion rate was around 60%.
