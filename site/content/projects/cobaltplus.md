summary: >-
  Mental health needs were disproportionately high among health care workers (HCWs) before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the rapid spread of the disease forced providers to grapple with additional stressors, including longer shifts, shortages of personal protective equipment, increased mortality and morbidity, and isolation. Cobalt is a platform that was developed at Penn Medicine to assist with this challenge. The goal of this research program is to assess the impact of and perhaps increase engagement with the COBALT platform by sending surveys and nudges to create appointments. Based on responses to surveys, employees will get a different nudge depending on PHQ and GAD scores.
