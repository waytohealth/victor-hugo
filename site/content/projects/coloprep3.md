summary: >-
  This is the next generation of the Coloprep program. Based on learnings from prior iteration, the program has been updated to include bi-directional text messaging to help answer patient questions. The goal remains the same - improve colonoscopy show-rates and increase adherence to prep required. This update also includes integration to Epic which allows the program to automatically text patients based on their upcoming appointment. The integration also takes into account appointment reschedules and cancellations.
