summary: The Nursing Care for Substance Use Disorder study explores whether
  in-person, patient first language training sessions at Penn nursing units
  and/or weekly educational text messaging affect nurses' attitudes towards
  patients with substance use disorder. Nurses complete a survey before and
  after receiving the 6-month intervention to measure changes in attitudes.
