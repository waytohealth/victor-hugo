summary: >-
  The intent of this study is to further explore the effect of collaboration and charity on increasing physical activity within families. The study specifically intends to test two interventions: 1) Gamification - using points to move participants up and down levels based on activity tracked through a Fitbit device, 2) Charity - using points to donate money to charity each week. Teams (cohorts) are created based on family members and the goal is to increase family physical activity.
