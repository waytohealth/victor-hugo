summary: "COVID Watch is a successful program that monitors COVID suspected
  patients at home via self-reported twice daily checkins, primarily focused on
  dyspnea. COVID Pulse was a program that was developed in parallel that sought
  to quantify dyspnea levels through the use of a pulse oximeter. The intent of
  this study was to randomize patients between the two programs to establish the
  additional value, if any, of the use of pulse oximeters. Enrollment in the
  program was completed in record time and results are pending publication. "
