summary: >-
  The intent of this clinical trial is to explore ways to improve the quality and number of serious illness conversations (SICs) with patients with a certain mortality risk or a documented Stage IV diagnosis. The nudges include pre-appointment reminders and a text based survey to both prime the conversation and also gather some of the patient's goals to better inform the upcoming appointment. Patient responses are collected and sent to the appropriate provider's in-basket.
