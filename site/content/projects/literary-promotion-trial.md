summary: >-
  The ability to read, write, speak, think and respond critically can open the
  door to many possibilities across the lifespan both in school and beyond,
  affecting how we interact with our communities, engage as citizens, consume
  health care, express ourselves and more. 


  Often, children of low-income parents experience disparities in these critical areas of development. Parent-child shared reading can help ameliorate these disparities, yet low-income parents do not consistently engage in this activity. Behavioral economics approaches utilizing automated hovering (AH) have the potential to increase parent-child shared reading opportunities through text messages and financial inducements.


  Formerly referred to as Parent Child Reading Pilot. This study at CHOP aims to develop materials to frame an evidence base to promote parents reading with children. It tests lottery or regret language to explore if that promotes more reading with children.
