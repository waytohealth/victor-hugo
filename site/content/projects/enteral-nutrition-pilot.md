summary: >
  The intent of this pilot is to use texting to outreach to patients discharged from the hospital on enteral nutrition (feeding tubes). Currently patients are discharged and there is no care home for them getting help or having questions asked around enteral nutrition leading to lots of follow-up calls and readmissions. The program will consist of twice weekly check-ins to see how the patients are doing.  The goal of the pilot is to show patient engagement with text messaging. The longer term goal is to reduce readmission rates amongst this population.
