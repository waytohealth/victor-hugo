summary: >-
  The Nursing Care for Substance Use Disorder study explores whether in-person, patient first language training sessions at Penn nursing units and/or weekly educational text messaging affect nurses' attitudes towards patients with substance use disorder. Nurses complete a survey before and after receiving the 6-month intervention to measure changes in attitudes.
