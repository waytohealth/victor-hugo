summary: Oncology patients spend a large proportion of their time attending in
  person clinical appointments. In TIME, a text-based intervention to minimize
  the time burden of routine clinical care, participants complete e-triage by
  text message. If cleared, they need not attend an office visit prior to their
  infusion appointment, reducing their travel time and number of in person
  appointments.
